WooCommerce Auto Account Creation
==========================


##Requirements

WordPress 3.x
WooCommerce 2.x


== Description ==
 
While you can achieve auto account creation with WooCommerce alone by disabling Guest Checkout, this creates some 
problems in some use cases. 
Particularly if the user already has an account, but doesn't actually want to login in order to be able to check out. 

This plugin allows you to leave guest checkout enabled, but behind the scenes, it looks for an existing account with the 
billing email, creates an account if it doesn't exists, and then associates the order with the account.
